# MIT 6.824: Distributed Systems - Spring 2020

This is my attempt to follow the class 6.824 about Distributed Systems. 

More info about the class can be found on the [class page](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/index.html)

## Notes

As opossed to previous years this edition of the class is presented in Go, so that is the language I'm using. More can be found [here](https://golang.org)
